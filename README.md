<h3> Currently working on: <i> Data Analysis</i> </h3>
I've been working on a data analysis project for the first time! In this project, I'm simulating an UNO game and trying to get results and conclusions about how the initial parameters interfers in the result of the game. It's a project of 'Modelling and Computational Simulation" a subject of my grad. Here is the repository of this project: <a href="https://github.com/julianasantiago100/uno_simulation">Uno bot - An UNO simulation </a>
